Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the NinjaCo app uses:

- This project uses the [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) library. Nextjs is a React framework that allows you to build server-side rendered React apps. It is a framework that allows you to build React apps with a lot of features out of the box, such as routing, server-side rendering, and more.
- For styling, the app uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- For authentication, the app uses [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/), an open source authentication library for Next.js.

- For testing, the app uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a JavaScript testing framework. Jest is a complete and easy to set-up JavaScript testing solution. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!

- For linting, the app uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), a pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.

- For persistent storage, the app uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.

- For backend API, the app uses [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.

- For image storage, the app uses [Minio](https://min.io/), an open source object storage server compatible with Amazon S3 APIs. Minio is a high performance distributed object storage server, designed for large-scale private cloud infrastructure.

- For code formatting, the app uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), an opinionated code formatter. Prettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, JSON, GraphQL, Markdown, and more. It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.
