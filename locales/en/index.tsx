    question1: 'Should i have previous knowledge in programming?',
    answer1:
      'No, you do not need to have previous knowledge in programming to learn coding using visual blocks. This approach is designed to be beginner-friendly and accessible to students with no prior coding experience.',
    question2: 'Do i need hardware parts?',
    answer2:
      'Well depends, for Arduino courses you will need some Arduino parts depending on the course',
    question3: 'Should i install any other software to connect to the Arduino?',
    answer3:
      'No, you do not need to install any additional software to connect to the Arduino if the website or platform you are using provides a built-in feature to connect and program the Arduino with visual blocks. The website or platform should have instructions on how to connect the Arduino and run your code directly without requiring any external software.',
    question4: 'Where can i register for the courses?',
    answer4:
      "You should be able to register for the courses on the website that offers the coding courses using visual blocks and Arduino. Look for a Register or Sign up button/link on the website's homepage or navigation menu. Clicking on that button/link should take you to a registration page where you can provide your information and enroll in the courses.",
